*There's some good intro content, but start at ~35:33 to skip the orientation content*
## PEGA
www.pega.com

There's three places that we'll be referring to a lot:
 - [PEGA Academy](https://academy.pega.com) (Specifically the System Architect section)
	 - There's modules that we can go through with relevant documentation and a quiz
		 - The modules should line up pretty well with the SkillStorm course schedule
	 - There's also "challenges" - where PEGA is installed on a virtual machine that we can remotely control to go through the process of building in PEGA
		 - Jordan advises us to experiment and explore while building in PEGA
 - [PEGA Documentation](https://docs.pega.com) 
	 - Loads of documentation to go through for reference
	 - If using GenAI for reference material or guidance, be aware that PEGA updates *often*, and to ensure that the information isn't referring to an old version
		 - When it comes to low-code platforms, when there's a new version, it means that they might move things around, change functionality of elements, change the steps to accomplish a task - that sort of thing
		 - **PEGA has an official AI tool called PEGA Study Buddy, which can be used as a potentially more-reliable resource for reference**
		 - *This course appears to have been created in 2023, so. hm.*
	 - You can download an up-to-date "book" of the documentation in a PDF format!
 - [My Pega](https://my.pega.com)
	 - Need to sign up - but has a lot of resources
	 - Under the `Software` tab -> `My Software` -> `Community Edition`, you can access a VM that allows you to use PEGA for free to get familiar with the tool
		 - Community edition is a temporary license - 30 days

## Terminology
*A lot of this we'll already know, but I'll note it here for reference*

 - **VM** - A virtualized instance of a computer. PEGA's Community version is a remote desktop stream of a VM with PEGA installed.

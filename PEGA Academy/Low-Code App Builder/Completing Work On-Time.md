## Service-Level Agreements

A **Service-Level Agreement** (SLA) establishes a work completion deadline.

In essence, there's a 1-100 level of urgency for a service-level agreement, and there can be milestones in the process at which the urgency can change, or actions can be triggered. 

## Service Level Intervals

As mentioned, a **Service-Level Agreement** can have different **Service-Level Intervals** at which a task should be completed, or a case should be resolved. For example, missing a 24 hour goal can send a notification, while exceeding 36 hours to complete a task might result in transferring the task to someone else.

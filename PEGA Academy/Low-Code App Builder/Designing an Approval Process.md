## Work Approval

**Case Approvals** are points in the case life cycle at which users must decide whether to approve or reject a case, e.g. an equipment upgrade request.

For this purpose, there is an **Approve/Reject** step for approvals in Pega.

### Routing

You can assign approvals to a specific user, a work queue, or use business logic.

### Routing Notifications

The email and mobile application approval options allow stakeholders to approve or reject cases outside of the app by responding to the email/notification.

### Flow

Typically, when an approval is received, a case will be continued - however, it can also be set to switch to a different state. Similarly, rejections can cause the case to continue, the state to be changed, or for the resolution to occur.

## UI Configuration in Constellation

Pega's Constellation UI architecture makes it possible to connect the frontend to a variety of data sources, including external APIs.

There's also **templates** for the frontend, a generic template for the UI that you can use to start building.

There's a number of automatically-generated views, such as...

**Full Page View:**
A default view. Has a 3-pane layout, with a summary section in the upper-left corner for grounding.

**Details** - This view is another default, optional view that can show read-only **Case** data.

**Pulse** - Allows users to post, view, and reply to messages in the context of a **Case**.

### Quiz Notes

```
The UI layer in the Constellation architecture subscribes to the **Principle of Separation of Concerns**, which is the software design principle that encourages software modularity by stipulating that an application should have distinct parts, where each part addresses a specific concern.

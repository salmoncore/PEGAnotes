Robust Pega applications rely upon **Domain Experts** and **Implementation Experts**.
 - **Domain Experts** - Business analysts, Citizen Developers, Front-End Developers - they all provide insight into processes and user needs.
 - **Implementation Experts** - System Architects, Full-Stack Developers, Database and Security Administrators - they provide the expertise needed to address desired use cases.

While the core application development is fleshed out in **App Studio** by **Domain Experts**, **Dev Studio** allows for complex application **rules** to be implemented by **Implementation Experts**.

**Dev Studio** also provides functionality for configuring application security, access control, and addressing performance limitations, alongside the **rule** configuration.

In many ways, the **Dev Studio** can be similar to the existing configuration that is possible in **App Studio**, while having additional options and programmatic controls:

As mentioned earlier in the course, Pega applications are intended to be worked on by Business Analysts/Citizen Developers and System Architects at the same time - **co-development**.

In **App Studio**, developers can **configure Rules** for a single case type, such as:
 - Processes
 - Views
 - Correspondence
 - Service Levels

In **Dev Studio**, developers can access all layers of an application, and can extend the **Rule Scope** from a single Case Type to an application, division, or the entire organization, to facilitate sharing a library of standardized, reusable **rules**.

There are **naming differences between Dev and App studio**:

| **App Studio**    | **Dev Studio**                |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Field             | Property                      |
| Goal and Deadline | Service-Level Agreement (SLA) |
| User              | Operator                      |
| Team              | Work Group                    |
*In **App Studio**, you add **fields** to data models and views. The system makes a corresponding **property** that can be modified in **Dev Studio***.

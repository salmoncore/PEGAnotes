## Roles on a Pega Project

Projects on a team can require a lot of members and roles. Here's a few:

 - **Specialty Architects** have a specific niche in the project they fulfill, e.g. a UX architect may be needed to design complex user views.
 - **System Administrator and IT** can provide infrastructure, security, or integration expertise.
 - **Consulting Solutions Executives** provide leadership and project direction, and should establish best practices and processes.
 - **Product Owners** own the product backlog and prioritization of items, alongside developing acceptance criteria.
 - **Project Delivery Leaders** provide a project plan and delivery guidance.
 - **Scrum Masters** promote and support Scrum practices.
 - **System Architects** design and configure the application.
	 - Lead or principal architects design the overall architecture
	 - Senior and system architects configure assets, such as UI forms and automation
	 - Names can change depending on organization
 - **Subject Matter Experts** have deep understanding of a business topic or domain, and helps convey business needs
 - **Quality Assurance** creates and runs functional and performance test scripts, participating in the Scrum team
 - **Business Architects** work with **Subject Matter Experts** and stakeholders to understand business needs
	 - Define business rules, *service level agreements*, and processes
 - **Citizen Developers** are non-technical business users who participate in the low-code App Studio development.

There can be a fair amount of overlap between roles as well.

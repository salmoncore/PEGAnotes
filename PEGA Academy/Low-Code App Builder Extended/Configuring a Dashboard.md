A **Dashboard** is a landing page that has widgets displaying summary information and **key performance indicators** (KPIs), presenting them in an intelligible format.

**Dashboards** have the option to be shared:
 - **Private** - only available to you
 - **Shared** - available to all users with access
 - **Public** - available to all users

When copying an existing dashboard, the dashboard will keep the visibility of the source dashboard. New dashboards are automatically set to private.

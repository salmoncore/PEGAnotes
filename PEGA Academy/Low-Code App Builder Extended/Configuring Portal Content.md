## Channel Interfaces

Examples of **Channels**:
 - A messaging service
 - Voice assistant
 - Web portal
 - Mobile application

As Pega supports a variety of **channels**, you can use the **channel interface** to adjust your app to your needs.

**Conversational Channels** allow for users to access your application through:
 - Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp
 - Amazon Alexa
 - Email, SMS
 - Etc.

The **Pega Intelligent Virtual Assistant** (IVA) and **Pega Email Bot** are another means of interacting with your application. The **IVA** can understand conversational language regardless of channel, while the **Email Bot** can detect the intent of an email and can extract information to automate processing.

You can configure your channels through the **Channels Landing Page**. Other channels, such as the Alexa Channel, can be added from the **Pega Marketplace**.

## Portals and Landing Pages

A **Portal** is the user interface of an application, consisting of **landing pages** that holds **case**-related information.

Pega supports two types of **Portals**:
 - Standard **Portals**, which help users complete complex workflows that require collaboration and data analysis.
 - Self-service **Portals**, offering a minimalistic design and a guided experience.

The default **Portal** is the **Web Portal**, intended to work on web and mobile.

**Landing Pages** can contain:
 - Lists of data
 - Widgets
 - Views
 - Insights

Pega has several out-of-the-box landing pages, such as a *My Work* landing page that displays a table with a list of work items assigned to the user. These can be edited from **App Studio** as well:

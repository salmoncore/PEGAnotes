## Agile Workbench

In **App Studio**, there's a **Developer Assistant** pane that helps organize work, using *developer aids*. There's four "aids": 

- **Guidance** tab
	- Used to review guidelines and best practices
- **Knowledge** tab
	- Presents content relevant to your recent actions, e.g. articles on automated processes
- **Work** tab
	- Used to access the *Agile Workbench*, has feedback and development status of features
- **Checklists** tab
	- Used to access ***checklists***, aka application guides

The **Agile Workbench** is used to track Agile feature development and capture project feedback.
 - You can create stories, bugs, feedback items
 - Each of these can be edited and resolved
 - There's organization features to help sort items

Note that:
 - *Features* are capabilities that you want your application to support
 - *Subfeatures* are features within a *feature*
 - *Stories*, or *User stories* are used to describe business requirements
 - *Bugs* document defects
 - *Feedback* items are enhancement requests - used to guide development

 - Every work item has a **status**; **To do**, **Doing**, or **Done**

**Quiz:**
Q: `How does Agile Workbench support agile development?`
A: `Agile Workbench provides continuous access to work item status and new work item creation.`

## Release Management with Pega Platform

**DevOps** practices allow development teams and business stakeholders to develop software in a continuous cycle, which ideally improves the pace of development.

`The three components for DevOps are people, process, and technology.`

### Continuous Integration and Delivery

Also known as CI/CD, this is an automated process to move applications from development through testing and deployment on a production system.

**Continuous integration** - changes to the app are integrated together using version control software.
**Continuous delivery** - application is built, run through testing, and deployed automatically.

`You can set up a (CI/CD) pipeline that uses a Pega repository to store and test software and a third-party automation server such as Jenkins that starts jobs and performs operations on your software.`

### DevOps Technology

The Pega platform has a pipeline tool called the **Deployment Manager**, which allows for testing and deployment of Pega apps.
 - You can start building with the **Deployment Manager**, and then transition to third-party solutions, as well.
 - **Deployment Manager** is accessed through the **Admin Studio** panel, and has its own dashboard:
	 - ![Deployment Manager Dashboard](attachments/Deployment_manager_1_0%201.webp)
 - Before publishing, you need to configure the **Deployment Manager** with **App Studio**. 

Q: `Which DevOps step identifies issues early on in the development cycle?`
A: `Ready to share`

## Agile Development Best Practices

Pega's best practices for Agile development include:
 - **Real-time Updates**
	 - Making frequent, small changes to a project
 - **Testing**
	 - Continuous testing for addressing issues early
 - **Branches**
	 - Allowing for concurrent team development

Q: `Which two statements are true about agile development and automated release management? (Choose Two)`
A: `Continuous integration allows you to regularly merge code changes into a central repository to facilitate automated build and test runs.` and `DevOps involves both business and technical team members in continuous integration and delivery.`

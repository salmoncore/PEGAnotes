## Agile Workbench

In **App Studio**, there's a **Developer Assistant** pane that helps organize work, using *developer aids*. There's four "aids": 

- **Guidance** tab
	- Used to review guidelines and best practices
- **Knowledge** tab
	- Presents content relevant to your recent actions, e.g. articles on automated processes
- **Work** tab
	- Used to access the *Agile Workbench*, has feedback and development status of features
- **Checklists** tab
	- Used to access ***checklists***, aka application guides

The **Agile Workbench** is used to track Agile feature development and capture project feedback.
 - You can create stories, bugs, feedback items
 - Each of these can be edited and resolved
 - There's organization features to help sort items

Note that:
 - *Features* are capabilities that you want your application to support
 - *Subfeatures* are features within a *feature*
 - *Stories*, or *User stories* are used to describe business requirements
 - *Bugs* document defects
 - *Feedback* items are enhancement requests - used to guide development

 - Every work item has a **status**; **To do**, **Doing**, or **Done**

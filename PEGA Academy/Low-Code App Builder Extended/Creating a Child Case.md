You can create a **top-level case**, which can be used as a parent for other cases that need to be handled before the parent can be resolved.

In this example, the *Accident Claim* is the **top-level case**, and *Vehicle Damage* and *Body Injury* are child cases. Again, the child cases must be resolved before the parent case can be resolved.

To help with this process, there is a Create Case automation step that can create an instance of a specified case type.

1. Refer to [Sizing a Pega Platform Project](Sizing%20a%20Pega%20Platform%20Project.md) - this is a little tricky compared to the example questions in here, so likely study this.

2. Remember that you're not doing any type of validation for the data provided in this example - and that you need all the information to decide whether or not you can get to the loan stage. Study.

3. The survey example almost got me. Study this as well:
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608163157.png)

4. Pretty straightforward, especially after the last question.

5. Remember that role permissions can be changed - the better answer is needing to change the channel and permissions. Study.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608163449.png)

6. Study, don't get mixed up with how channels can be used!
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608163633.png)

7. Almost got pre/post processing and the data initialization sections mixed up, study this as well.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608164455.png)

8. Straightforward, all set on this one.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608164531.png)

9. Straightforward as well.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608164653.png)

10. Remember that decision shapes should be used when there is a distinct branch in a process - the other examples don't really wholly change direction, which can be better handled by other features in Pega. Study this.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608165448.png)

11. Straightforward - remember that custom conditions can assess rules as well.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608165552.png)

12. Straightforward again, make sure to read carefully.

13. I just studied this but study again - review [Inviting Users to an Application](Inviting%20Users%20to%20an%20Application.md)'s explanation of this question.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608170159.png)

14. Intuitive enough.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608170247.png)

15. I just studied this as well, and it makes sense - study if the wording seems weird in the future.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608170345.png)

16. Process of elimination made this very easy, study.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608171030.png)

17. Don't overthink this type of question lol. Study.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608171331.png)

18. Got the terminology mixed up - information is *propagated* from the parent to the child, you can't reference it in App Studio. Study.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608172619.png)

19. Wait steps are dependent upon child case completion - don't overthink it. Study.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608172816.png)

20. Channels are the different ways a user can access the app, portals are **specific to the web** (think *web portals*) - these portals have landing pages, which is where you land when entering the website. Study.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608173016.png)

21. Study, but it's straightforward.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608173403.png)

22. Study.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608173552.png)

23. Study.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608173727.png)

24. Study dashboard and KPIs.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608173937.png)

25. Good on this one.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608174033.png)

26. Careful not to mix up case dependency for *just* dependency.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608174128.png)

27. Review [Inviting Users to an Application](Inviting%20Users%20to%20an%20Application.md) - this one still isn't super intuitive to me. Study.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608174225.png)

28. Easy peasey.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608174525.png)

29. Study this - Stage-only optional actions are the best answer. Note that you can't configure optional actions with **when rules**, optional actions are **not** inheritable, and optional actions cannot be configured to be case-wide and use user-specific parameters.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250608175152.png)

30. Study. Review [Calculating Fields using Decision Tables](Calculating%20Fields%20using%20Decision%20Tables.md) - the parts that can be written as an expression immediately are well-suited for this, while decision tables can handle calculations that may branch. For the Loan example, read carefully - it appears that the period is already determined by the user.

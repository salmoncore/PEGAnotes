## Optional Actions

Depending on situation, you may want specific tasks in a **Case's Life Cycle** to be completed. You can define these through **Optional Actions**.

E.g., while reporting a car accident, you may have a customer mention getting a new phone number - an optional action can handle a profile update.

In this similar circumstance, an *update contact* screen can be displayed, which can then seamlessly transition from and to the loan information stage.

It's possible to use **Optional Actions** as a final stage as well - in this example, cancelling an order is a multi-step process, which is supported by **optional actions**.

### Case-wide and Stage-only Actions

You can add **optional actions** as *case-wide* or *stage-only*.

 - **Stage-only:** For use in a specific stage.
	 - E.g., when placing an order, you can go to the optional "cancel order" stage, which can only be reached from the "Confirm Billing Details" stage.
 - **Case-wide:** Can be reached at any time.
	 - E.g., at any point during a car accident report, you can have your contact information updated - the form is  reachable during the entire process.

Optional actions *can be set to run at runtime of the app*.

Pega has a few collaboration tools you can use:
 - **Pulse** lets you post messages to specific users or teams
 - **Tags** allow you to classify and manage cases and **Pulse** posts
 - Both **Pulse** and **Tags** can be accessed as widgets from **App Studio**.

**Pulse** can be accessed from the *Developer Collaboration* icon, or the corresponding icon in the *User Portal*.

Messages sent in **Pulse** can receive likes and comments - Note that specific users can be "tagged" using the @ symbol.

Additionally, you can enable email notifications for **Pulse** messages.

**Tags** work a lot like hashtags on social media - you can use a descriptive phrase to associate messages, cases, and more under one category.

The **Tags** widget can then be used to view all relevant items with the same tag:

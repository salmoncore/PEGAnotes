*What's a case lifecycle? What's a microjourney? We'll get there.*
We have a general sense of what low-code does for us, and how PEGA envisions our development approach - it's called the the **PEGA Express Delivery Approach.**

*This itself is a Microjourney - **it's Agile - a way of working.***

### Customer Journeys
 - Customer interactions are referred to as **Customer Journeys**
	 - A **Journey**, being an interaction between a customer and the organization
	 - The steps to achieve a business goal - e.g. hiring a job candidate, servicing a vehicle
		 - Hiring a candidate: Take in resume, do interviews, start onboarding, etc.
		 - All steps involved in these processes constitute a **Journey**
 - PEGA Express uses "design thinking" for **minimum loveable product (MLP)** releases
	 - MLP - "Just enough features to delight your users and validate your product idea"
	 - **The smallest, simplest version of a product that solves a user's problem well**
	 - If you're doing an HR application, and you can intake a form, that might be MLP 1
	 - If the business needs change, and you allow for detail editing afterwards, that'd be MLP 2

*Side tangent: PEGA's versioning allows us to control which application the user is working out of.*
*E.g., you can have a user running on MLPv1, and another running MLPv2 - maybe like AB testing?*
